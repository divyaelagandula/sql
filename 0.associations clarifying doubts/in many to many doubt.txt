Let's explain the Sequelize command const updatedstudent = await student.findByPk(studentid, { include: course }); step-by-step, showing how it uses the entries in your tables to build the final output.

We will use the following example data, assuming a Many-to-Many (M:M) relationship between student and course via the Student_Courses junction table.

Example Table Data

1. students Table

id	name	email
101	Alice	alice@mail.com

2. courses Table

id	courseName
300	Calculus
450	History
500	Chemistry

3. Student_Courses (Junction Table)

This table defines the current enrollment links:
studentId	courseId
101	300
101	450
102	500

Step-by-Step Execution

The command is executed with studentid = 101.

Step 1: Find the Primary Record (The student table)

    Sequelize Action: student.findByPk(101)

    SQL Action: SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 101;

Sequelize fetches the student's base data:
JavaScript

// studentData
{ id: 101, name: "Alice", email: "alice@mail.com" }

Step 2: Identify the Association

    Sequelize Action: Sees the option { include: course }.

    Association Logic: Since the association is M:M, Sequelize knows it must use the intermediary table, Student_Courses, to find the linked records.

Step 3: Find the Links (The Student_Courses table)

    SQL Action: SELECT * FROM Student_Courses WHERE studentId = 101;

Sequelize identifies the linking records:
studentId	courseId
101	300
101	450

Step 4: Fetch the Associated Data (The courses table)

    SQL Action: Using the courseId values (300 and 450) found in Step 3, Sequelize performs a query to get the details of those courses:
    SELECT * FROM courses WHERE id IN (300, 450);

Sequelize fetches the full course details:
JavaScript

[
    { id: 300, courseName: "Calculus" },
    { id: 450, courseName: "History" }
]

Step 5: Assemble the Final JSON Object

    Sequelize Action: Sequelize combines the base student data (Step 1) with the array of course data (Step 4), nesting the associated records inside a property named courses.

    Crucially, Sequelize also attaches the data from the junction table (Step 3) to prove the link, placing it in the nested object named Student_Courses.

Final updatedstudent Output

The final JavaScript object returned by the function:
JSON

{
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@mail.com",
    // ... other student attributes

    "courses": [
        {
            "id": 300,
            "courseName": "Calculus",
            "Student_Courses": {
                "studentId": 101,
                "courseId": 300
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 450,
            "courseName": "History",
            "Student_Courses": {
                "studentId": 101,
                "courseId": 450
            }
        }
    ]
}
